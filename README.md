# Introduction: -

Creating different classification models to predict whether a loan is approved or not and finding the accuracy for each of these models to see how the different models compare to one another.
This is a Supervised Machine Learning Problem.
The different steps involved are  -> 

1.) Importing the Dependencies.

2.) Data Processing and Data Analysis.

3.) Splitting Data into Training and Test data.

4.) Training the different classification models.

5.) Evaluating each of these models to find their respective accuracy scores using training and testing data.


## Prerequirements for the code file: -

1.) Jupyter Notebook or google collab.

2.) train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv provided with this repository.


## How to run the code: -

1.) Open the jupyter notebook terminal(or upload and open in google collab) 

2.) Navigate to the folder where the zip file is extracted to and open the respective .ipynb file provided in their respective folder. The code and the output to that code will be visible.

3.) To rerun the whole notebook again, press kernel and press Restart and run all. (For jupyter notebook users)
